Responsive Web Design layout testing system. 

splits lets you see your website or webapp in multiple iframes sized approproatley to trigger media queries in your css. This gives you the ability to test for multiple device screen sizes (not actual device behavior, only screen size). Use this as your first step in mobile testing, but not at a replacement for real device or emulated testing.
