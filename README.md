###splits really works best right now on large screens, while it is a tool to test responsive sites splits itself is not responsive per se.

splits lets you see your website or webapp in multiple iframes sized approproatley to trigger media queries in your css. This gives you the ability to test for multiple device screen sizes (not actual device behavior, only screen size). Use this as your first step in mobile testing, but not at a replacement for real device or emulated testing. This is a beta, and there are still bugs to work out, but I would love to expand on this concept.
